# Activity 2

> Take a few notes and by the end of each and develop one sentence that you can use to describe each item.
> Don't worry if you're unclear on one thing or another, the main goal is to construct your own definition for each concept.
> We will clear up any misconceptions in the synchronous discussion.

## Ontology

- The branch of philosophy based on the studying of existance.
- Existance is a spectrumilistic property.

The author belives that qualitative arguments are a wasted of time because only quantitative topics have a firm end goal: where to draw the line in the sand.

## Epistemology

- Metaphysics: what exists or doesn't exist.
  - Seems like another word for Ontology.
- Epistemology is complimentary to metaphysics:
  - Follow up: How do you know that?
  - Justification is required.
- Word break down:
  - Episteme: knowledge
  - ology = logos: an account of/for

Argues that the discussion of Epistemolgy is to learn how to understand what's true from what's false.
