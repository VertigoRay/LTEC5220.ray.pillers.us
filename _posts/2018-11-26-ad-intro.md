[CAS](https://its.cas.unt.edu) supports the largest group of academic units in the [UNT System (UNTS)](https://www.untsystem.edu).
As such, we get a new account and access permission requests daily.
In today’s technological age, we must resolve these request within the working day, if not within the hour that they were requested.
Not having access to work systems is typically a critical error for any of our faculty and staff.

Due to expectations and short timelines, this process is mostly automated.
As with anything we automate, it’s nearly impossible to catch all the edge cases.
As we do, we try to make improvements.
However, we need to finish these *uncaught exceptions* manually until they are fixed.

## AD Objects Training

This training corresponds with the `UNT WS ADObjects.pptx` PowerPoint presentation.
The slides have notes included, but keep in mind a few key concepts:

> This training is more of a familiarization and open discussion about how to do things in AD.
> The slideshow shouldn’t be used to lecture through the topic.
> It should be used to guide discussion and keep on topic.
