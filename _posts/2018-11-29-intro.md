- Cross-Training
---
The goal of this training is to allow the advancement of technicians and colleagues to do higher level tasks.
Some things affect learning and need to be fixed immediately.

The WSM handles all the Windows server requests that come in.
Most of the time, these requests are automated, but occasionally, the automated systems cannot handle the request.
These tasks are perfect candidates to cross-train forseveral reasons:

- There are a lot of current examples that we have available to us.
- They are relatively simple tasks, that come in frequent enough that they become a burden.
- They can be quickly trained and re-trained as needed.

As we work through the training remember one important thing.
Although the learners are technologically proficient, they may not have any real-world experience with the types of requests that we will be covering.
Additionally, some technicians have more experience than others, and may breeze through this process.
They should allow new technicians the opportunity to discuss solutions in a group without recourse.

## Main Course Outcomes

- Proficiency with creation and management of Active Directory (AD) objects.
- Proficiency with creation and management of Windows network shares.
- Comfortable with written technical communication to non-technical people.
