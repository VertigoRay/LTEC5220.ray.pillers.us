The virtual lab should be ready to work with shortly.
When it’s done, you should have four VMs running in VirtualBox, they will look something like the ones shown in the picture at right.
Once they are all running, we can get started with the rest of the lab.

The VMs should automatically bind to the `UNTDV` domain.
You will need an account on that domain to login to the *Windows 10* VM.
You should never login to the *Windows Server 2016* VM.
You will be managing it from the Window 10 VM using Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT).

Every good organization needs to have standards and conventions.
Here’s some information you will need to adhere to the standards and conventions:
- **IT Support Name (Abbr)**: `Computing for Arts + Sciences (CAS)`
- **Domain User Names**: `euid9123`
  - The username will be set to the university assigned Employee Unique ID (EUID). For purposes of this training, all EUIDs have a leading digit of 9 (`euid9123`).
  - **AD User Required Properties**:
    - *SamAccountname*: set to the university assigned EUID.
    - *EmployeeID*: set to the university assigned EUID.
    - *EmployeeNumber*: set to the university assigned Employee Number. For purposes of this training, all EMPLIDs have two leading digits of 99 (`99345678`).
    - *Mail (aka E-mail)*: must be `firstname.lastname@unt.edu` where firstname can be a non-vanity nickname. For the purposes of this training, the domain for all generated accounts will be `@donotreply.unt.edu` (or `@mytestunt.onmicrosoft.com`; TBD).
    - *UserPrincipalName (UPN)*: must be set the same as the *Mail* attribute.
- **Domain Group Names**: `DEPT-FunctionalDescription`
  - `DEPT-`: official departmental abbreviation; ALL CAPS.
  - `FunctionalDescription`: a functional description of what the group is for, written in PascalCase, keep abbreviations to a minimum.
- **Domain Computer Names**: `CAS-123456`
  - `CAS`-: IT support abbreviation followed by a hyphen.
  - `123456`: Computer’s serial number
  - The computer name cannot exceed 15 characters; see [computer naming convention guidelines](/training/computer-naming-convention/).

For purposes of this training, assume that all emails came digitally signed from the person in the signature block.
This means that there is no need to worry about spoofed emails; the signature block always matched the from-address and digital signature of the email.

You will be considered to have *mastery* over the topic (or task set) if two of the tasks are completed using PowerShell; this does not include any preparation step.
If you have mastery over the task set, they can proceed to the next task set immediately.
